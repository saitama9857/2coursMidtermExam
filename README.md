Tic-tac-toe - What is the current state of the game? In a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, two players take turns marking an available cell in a 3-by-3 grid with their respective tokens (either X or O). When one player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has won. A draw (no winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and neither player has achieved a win.
